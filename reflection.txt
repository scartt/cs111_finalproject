Sijia Li -- Final Project Report
I choose an essay from New York Times and another one from Wall Street Journal as my source texts, and four new texts from Boston Globe, China Daily, The Economics and the BBC News. They both mention the topic of Christmas, so they may have more similar content for controlling the variables. The results of my comparisons is -- Boston Globe is more likely to come from New York Times; The Economist is more likely to come from New York Times; China Daily is more likely to come from Wall Street Journal; BBC News is more likely to come from Wall Street Journal. 

I think my program does well in comparing the number of types of punctuations but it sometimes reflect little of the style of the writer. I presume that the longer the text, the more accurate the results. However, the six types of newspapers are written by numerous writers with different personal styles. And I only randomly choose one from them. There are can be many deviations during the comparison. There are many elements can be added using methods we have not learned in class. For example, I also want to test the frequency of specific of phrases in  a text, or the use of data and verbs. But they all require more build-functions that we have not learned.
